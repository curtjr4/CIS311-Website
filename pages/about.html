					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<section id="overview">
						<p>I am a part-time college student pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems with a Cybersecurity emphasis while also working as a Desktop Support Technician and helping my company's IT Infrastructure and Operations team. Ever since I was a little kid, I always enjoyed tinkering around with technology -- figuring out how a device works, how to create computer programs to make life easier, and building new computers. I aspire to move into a full-time Linux System Administrator role once I am done with my bachelor's degree and earn my Red Hat Certified System Administrator certificate, as well as my Cisco CCNA certificate.</p>
					</section>
					<h2>Academic Asperations</h2>
					<section>
						<p class="mobile-center">I am currently a senior at Colorado State University at Pueblo, and currently hold the following credentials:</p>

					<h2>Work History</h2>
					<p class="mobile-center">
						Since I have been out of high school, I have primarily worked in customer service with King Soopers (owned by Kroger). The experience that I have had working with customers face-to-face has proven to be invaluable as I have been working as a Desktop Support Technician with Land Title Guarantee Company, and will continue to help me as I continue to learn and grow in my career.
