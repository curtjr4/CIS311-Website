					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<section id="overview">
						<p>I am a part-time college student pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems with a Cybersecurity emphasis while also working as a Desktop Support Technician and helping my company's IT Infrastructure and Operations team. Ever since I was a little kid, I always enjoyed tinkering around with technology -- figuring out how a device works, how to create computer programs to make life easier, and building new computers. I aspire to move into a full-time Linux System Administrator role once I am done with my bachelor's degree and earn my Red Hat Certified System Administrator certificate, as well as my Cisco CCNA certificate.</p>
					</section>
					<h2>Academic Asperations</h2>
					<section>
						<p class="mobile-center">I am currently a senior at Colorado State University at Pueblo, and currently hold the following credentials:</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul class="ulLeft">
							<li>Associates of Applied Science in Cybersecurity, issued by Arapahoe Community College in Littleton, CO.</li>
							<li>Certificate of Computer Information Systems, issued by Arapahoe Community College in Littleton, CO.</li>
							<li>Linux Pro, issued by TestOut Corporation.</li>
							<li>Guardicore Certified Segmentation Administrator, issued by Akamai Technologies.</li>
							<li>National Cyber League Spring 2021 Individual Game, issued by Cyber Skyline. This is a capture the flag event for computer hacking skills, and I ranked in the 97th percentile overall, and 77th percentile in the gold bracket.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>As I am about to finish by Bachelors of Science in Computer Information Systems with a Cybersecurity concentration, I plan on taking a short break to focus on certifications as well as my job; however, within the next five years, I do aspire to look at receiving a masters degree.</p>
					</section>
					<h2>Career Asperations</h2>
					<section id="career">
						<p>I am currently aspiring to become a Linux System Administrator. I currently work on Linux servers that are RHEL-based, but I would like to focus on Linux system administration.</p>
					</section>
					<h2>Hobbies</h2>
					<section id="hobbies">
						<p>When I am not at work, I enjoy hiking, skiing, mountain biking, traveling, and when I am at home, using my homelab environment to learn new enterprise technologies and make upgrades is a go-to. I enjoy staying busy and learning about enterprise technologies and deploying them within my homelab environment.</p>
