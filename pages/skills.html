				<h1>College Skills</h1>
				<p>While I was attending Arapahoe Community College and Colorado State University at Pueblo, I have learned a number of valuable skills that pertain to Computer Information Systems as well as Cybersecurity. Many of the notable hard skills that I have learned include:</p>
				<p><ul>
					<li>Vulnerability Assessment</li>
					<li>Basic Linux System Administration</li>
					<li>Firewalls and how they work (not vendor specific)</li>
					<li>Basic Cisco iOS Syntax</li>
					<li>Basic Microsoft Windows Server Administration</li>
					<li>Hypervisors/System Virtualization (VMWare ESXi)</li>
					<li>Computer Networking (Trained with CompTIA Network+ Material)</li>
					<li>Website Creation (HTML, CSS)</li>
					<li>Exposure the Java, Python, and C# Programming Languages</li>
					<li>Network Scanning Tools (Greenbone, Nessus, NMAP)</li>
					<li>Basic Cybersecurity Concepts (Trained with CompTIA Security+ Material)</li>
					<li>Metasploit</li>
					<li>Lockheed Martin Cyber Killchain</li>
					<li>Internet Privacy/Evasion Techniques</li>
				</ul></p>
				<p>Although the degree program proved to be rigorous and exposed us to many materials, the above is some of the most notable and is not an accurate reflection of my entire college career, as well as the skills that I have learned while working an IT job where I get exposure to many other products and technologies, such as SD-WAN, microcegmentation, as well as gaining experience with hyperconvered infrastructure such as the Nutanix platform and the Acropolis Hypervisor.</p>
